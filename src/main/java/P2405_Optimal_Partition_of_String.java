    2405. Optimal Partition of String https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-partition-of-string/description/
Given a string s, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique.
That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once.
Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.
Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.

Example 2:
Input: s = "ssssss"
Output: 6
Explanation:
The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
